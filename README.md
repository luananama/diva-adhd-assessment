# 💖 About This Project

I created this project as a way for me to learn and practice front-end development, product thinking, and project management. Additionally, I am passionate about mental health and would like to support better digital tools in this field.

It’s open source, and contributions are more than welcome — whether it’s code, feedback, or just helpful ideas! It's still a work in progress and I'm learning as I go :)

# Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA) Web Application

A web-based platform for administering the **DIVA 2.0 ADHD assessment**, built with React (Next.js). This application streamlines the evaluation process for clinicians by automating question flow, scoring, and report generation.

It is intended as a tool for medical professionals, and therefore does not provide a diagnosis or any interpretation of the ADHD evaluation beyond the summary of the answers. The target language is Romanian.
